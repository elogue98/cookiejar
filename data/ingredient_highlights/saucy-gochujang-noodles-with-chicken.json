        "3 tablespoons soy sauce",

        "2 tablespoons tomato paste",
        "2 tablespoons peanut butter",
        "2 tablespoons water",
        "1–2 tablespoons brown sugar",
        "1 tablespoon sesame oil",

      "steps": [
        "Whisk the sauce ingredients (except the extra broth) in a small bowl or shake together in a jar. It should form a thick sauce.",
        "Cook the chicken in a large skillet over medium high heat. Season generously with salt and pepper.",
        "Boil the noodles for just a few minutes to soften. Drain and set aside.",
        "When the chicken is done, add spinach, cooked noodles, and sauce to the pan, keeping it over medium high heat. Toss to combine; heat until the spinach is wilted. Add extra water or broth to thin the sauce, a little at a time, to get the sauciness that you like (I usually add about 1 1/2 cups total).",
        "Serve topped with fresh herbs, scallions, chili oil, sesame seeds, and whatever else you like."
