        "2 teaspoons smoked paprika",
        "2 teaspoons onion powder",
        "1 teaspoon garlic powder",
        "1/2 teaspoon chili powder",

        "MANGO SALSA:",
        ": Toss all ingredients in a bowl to combine. Taste, adjust, try not to eat the whole bowl.",
        "COOK YOUR RICE:",
        "Get your rice cooking according to package directions.",
        "GET THE OVEN READY:",
        "Preheat the oven to 475 degrees. Line a baking sheet with foil. Alternatively, you can set it to 500 degrees on the broil setting for medium rare with a yummy crispy top – the risk here is that you have to watch closely so it doesn’t burn the sugar. If taking this route, make sure one of the oven racks is close-ish to the top, about 6 inches or so.",
        "SALMON:",
        "Mix the spices and the olive oil to make a paste. Place the salmon skin side down on the baking sheet. Rub the paste liberally over the top part of the salmon. Bake for 6-12 minutes depending on the thickness of your salmon and your desired doneness. See notes if you’re not sure.",
        "BOWL IT UP:",
        "Pile up some rice, pull off some of salmon, and spoon that mango avocado salsa over the whole thing. Add a lime squeezer for good measure. IT’S SO GOOD."
