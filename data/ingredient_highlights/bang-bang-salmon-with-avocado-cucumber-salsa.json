        "MAKE THE BANG BANG SAUCE:",

        "BAKE THE SALMON:",
        "Spread a small spoonful of sauce over the seasoned salmon pieces. Bake for 10 minutes towards the top of the oven. Then turn the broiler on for another 2-3 minutes, until your salmon looks golden brown and a bit caramelized on top.",
        "SERVE:",
        "Serve the salmon over rice, with a vegetable of choice, and the reserved bang bang sauce + chili crisp drizzled over top! So easy and so good."
