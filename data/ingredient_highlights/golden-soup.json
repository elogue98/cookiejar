        "SIMMER:",
        "Add the water (I usually start with 4 cups) and salt. Simmer until softened.",
        "BLEND:",
        "Transfer the soup to a blender and blend into a creamy consistency. It’s best to do this in batches.",
        "FINISH:",
        "Return to the soup pot and add any additional water (remaining 2-3 cups) if you need to thin it out. Also a good time to season with more salt and a squeeze of lemon juice. Also a good time to top with spiced chickpeas and parsley and olive oil and more salt and put on your most comfy sweater and FALL IN LOVE. ♡"
